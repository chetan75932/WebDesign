        <i><p>
            Cristiano Ronaldo was named after one of the US former President Ronald Reagan by his father. Ronaldo was born into a family with a limited income source, and he also revealed in some conferences how he used to live in a small cottage with his other siblings, sharing a small room with them.

When Ronaldo informed his family that he wanted to be a football player, his mother encouraged him to pursue his ambition. Ronaldo is now a fantastic football player due to his mother's support.
